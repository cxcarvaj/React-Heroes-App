# Hooks App

This is my React Hooks App project repository built with Vite. I used this repository to learn more about React and its hooks using some real examples.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn dev`

To run the app in the development mode.\

<!-- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. -->

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

To build the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `yarn test`

To run all the unit tests in this project.

### `yarn test:watch`

To run all the unit test and watch files for changes and rerun tests related to changed files. -->
